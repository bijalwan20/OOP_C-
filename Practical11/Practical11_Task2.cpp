/*Multiple Inheritance in C++ :
    Create two classes named Mammals and MarineAnimals. Create another class named BlueWhale which inherits both the above classes. Now, create a function in each of these
    classes which prints "I am Mammal", "I am a Marine Aniimal" and "I belong to both the categories : Mammals as well as Marine Animals" respectively. Now, create an object
    for each of the above and try calling :
    
    1. function of Mammals by an object of Mammal
    2. function of MarineAnimal by an object of MarineAnimal
    3. function of BlueWhale by an object of BlueWhale
    4. function of each of its parent by the object of BlueWhale
